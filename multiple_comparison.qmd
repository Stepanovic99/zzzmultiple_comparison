# Objectives

-   get an understanding of issues related to multiple comparisons in clinical trials

The theoretical background is based on @schumacher2008methodik and \@@moye200721.

# Theoretical background

@moye200721 states: "Multiple comparisons (or multiple testing situations) are simply the collection of statistical hypothesis tests that are executed at the conclusion of a research effort." This might for example be the case when there are multiple endpoints or when conducting subgroup analyses.

::: callout-note
Recall that a *type 1 error* (or false positive) is the probability of rejecting the null although the null is true. $\alpha$, the significance level, is the upper acceptable limit for a type 1 error.

::: callout-note
Recall that the p-value is defined as the probability of getting a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one we observed, given the $H_0$ is true.

@moye200721 further states: "The process is straightforward. The investigators should first identify each of the analyses that they wish to assess at the studyâ€™s conclusion. Once this exhaustive process of analysis identification has completed, the investigators should then choose the small number of endpoints for which a type I error rate will be allocated. It is over this final subset of endpoints that the overall type I error level will be controlled. Other analyses that cannot be recognized prospectively will fall into the class of exploratory analyses."

## Difference global and multiple $\alpha$

Suppose we have k null hypotheses $H^0 ... H^k$, then the global $\alpha$ is the limit for the probability of rejecting *at least* one of these hypotheses although they are all true. The multiple $\alpha$ is the limit for the probability of rejecting *at least* one from a **subset** of these hypotheses although they are true.
In case of k multiple null hypotheses, the multiple $\alpha$ is calculated as $$1-(1-\alpha)^k$$

Therefore, survival function and hazard function are related.
